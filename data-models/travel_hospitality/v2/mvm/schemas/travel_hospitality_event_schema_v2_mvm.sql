Each record captures one menu selection within a BEO function, including the number of covers ordered, any negotiated per-person price override, the confirmed attendee count for kitchen production, and group-specific dietary notes. This is the primary operational record used by catering managers, kitchen teams, and event coordinators to execute food and beverage service for MICE events. Managed within Delphi by Amadeus and reconciled against MICROS POS for billing.. Existence Justification: In MICE catering operations, a single BEO routinely covers multiple distinct meal functions (e.g., morning coffee break, working lunch, afternoon reception, gala dinner), each referencing a different catering menu from the property catalog. Conversely, any given catering menu (e.g., Mediterranean Buffet) is reused across hundreds of BEOs annually. The relationship is not a simple reference — each BEO-menu pairing carries its own operational data: the number of covers ordered, any per-person price override negotiated for that event, and dietary notes specific to that group. This is a textbook operational M:N that the hospitality industry recognizes as a BEO Menu Selection or catering order line.';
