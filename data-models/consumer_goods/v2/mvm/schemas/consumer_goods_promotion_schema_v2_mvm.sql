Managed by brand managers and trade finance teams in TPM systems as a distinct operational entity.. Existence Justification: In Consumer Goods TPM, a trade promotion can draw funding from multiple funding agreements (e.g., an annual lump-sum RFA plus a scan-back agreement plus a co-op fund), and a single funding agreement (e.g., an annual JBP) can fund multiple distinct trade promotions across the year. Brand managers and trade finance teams actively manage these allocations — deciding how much of each agreements budget is committed to each promotion — as a distinct operational process in systems like Salesforce TPM and SAP TPM. The relationship itself carries financial data (allocated_amount, allocation_percentage, funding_type) that belongs neither to the promotion nor the agreement alone, but to the specific funding commitment between them.';
