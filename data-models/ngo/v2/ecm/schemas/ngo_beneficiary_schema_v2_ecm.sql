It captures the humanitarian assistance entitlement rules that define which commodities each beneficiary is entitled to receive, in what quantities, at what frequency, and for what duration. Each record links one registrant to one commodity with entitlement-specific parameters including quantity per distribution cycle, distribution frequency, entitlement validity period, vulnerability-based adjustments, and special dietary requirements. This is the operational SSOT for ration planning, distribution planning, and beneficiary entitlement verification in food security and NFI distribution programs.. Existence Justification: In humanitarian operations, beneficiaries are entitled to receive multiple commodities simultaneously as part of their assistance package (e.g., a monthly food basket includes rice, oil, beans, salt, and a household receives multiple NFI items like blankets, jerry cans, soap). Each commodity is entitled to thousands of beneficiaries across the program. The entitlement relationship is an operational business entity actively managed by program officers, carrying specific data about quantity per distribution cycle, frequency, validity period, vulnerability-based adjustments, and special dietary requirements that belong to neither the beneficiary nor the commodity alone.
