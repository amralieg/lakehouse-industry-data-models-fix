    `standard_teardown_time_minutes` DECIMAL(18,2) COMMENT 'Standard teardown time in minutes required to complete and clean up after an operation at this work center. [Moved from work_center: Same reasoning — teardown time varies by operation and product, making it a routing_operation attribute rather than a fixed work_center master attribute.]',

    CONSTRAINT pk_routing_operation PRIMARY KEY(`routing_operation_id`)
) COMMENT 'This association product represents the Operation Step — the assignment of a work center to a specific ordered step within a manufacturing routing. It captures the sequence, standard times, control parameters, and activity types that define what work is performed, where it is performed, and how long it takes at each step of the production process. Each record links one routing to one work center at a specific operation sequence position, carrying attributes that exist only in the context of this routing-step-work_center combination. This is the SSOT for operation-level production process definitions and is the canonical M:N resolution between routing and work_center in all major ERP/MES systems (SAP PP routing operation, Oracle WIP operation, etc.).. Existence Justification: In manufacturing ERP systems (SAP PP, Oracle MFG, etc.), a routing is composed of multiple ordered operation steps, each assigned to a specific work center. A single routing can reference many work centers (e.g., step 10 at Lathe WC, step 20 at Mill WC, step 30 at Assembly WC), and a single work center can appear in many different routings across different products. The routing_operation is the canonical first-class business entity that represents this assignment — it carries operation sequence, standard times, control keys, and activity types that belong to neither the routing nor the work center alone.';
