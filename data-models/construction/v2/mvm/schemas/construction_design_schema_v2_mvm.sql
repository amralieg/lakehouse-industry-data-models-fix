It captures which section of a specification governs a given drawing, the compliance verification status, and any approved deviations. Each record links one drawing to one technical_specification with attributes that exist only in the context of this governing relationship — forming the drawing-specification cross-reference matrix that is a standard contractual deliverable on EPC and design-build construction projects.. Existence Justification: In construction engineering, drawings and technical specifications have a genuine operational many-to-many relationship: a single structural drawing may reference multiple specifications (concrete, rebar, formwork), and a single specification (e.g., Division 03 Concrete) governs dozens of drawings across multiple disciplines. Engineers actively maintain drawing-specification compliance matrices as formal project deliverables, tracking which sections of a spec apply to which drawings and whether each drawing is compliant with the governing specification.';
